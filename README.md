### Subtask 1 Why I did decide to participate in Dare IT Challenge?

One year ago I decide to change my profession definitely. Then I started learning testing on my own. I passed ISTQB exam and learned some new skills
on the Udemy platform.

In autumn my friend told me about Dare IT. I started to observe girls from Dare IT on Linked In and Instagram. 
I was on a few webinars. I attended an online job fair organized by Dare IT and I fell in love with that organization. 
After the job fair, I was very uplifted and determined to get new skills and start my career in IT as QA Tester. 
The automation part of testing is very alluring for me, I loved working with software, testing applications, and developing my digital skills.
I'm pleased that I can do that with Dare It. I believe that I will be a good tester able to automate tests.:smiley:
